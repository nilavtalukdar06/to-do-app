# To-Do App

A modern, full-stack To-Do application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This project demonstrates best practices in React, API routing, and modular code organization. It provides a simple yet extensible foundation for managing tasks, with a focus on maintainability and scalability.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This To-Do App allows users to:

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- View all tasks in a clean, responsive UI

The project is structured for easy extension (e.g., adding authentication, database, or advanced features).
